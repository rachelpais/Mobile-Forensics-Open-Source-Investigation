# Mobile Forensics: Open-Source Investigation

## Overview
This repository contains a dissertation-style guide on mobile forensics, focusing on Android devices. The guide provides a step-by-step tutorial for beginners to perform mobile forensic analysis using open-source tools in isolated virtual environments, ensuring data integrity and hands-on learning.

## Objective
The aim of this research is to create a practical guide that allows students to analyze mobile devices without compromising evidence integrity. The guide demonstrates workflows, tool comparison, and virtual environment setup to prepare learners for real-world digital investigations.

## Tools Used
- **Autopsy** – Open-source digital forensics platform with a large user community.  
- **Avilla Forensics** – Lightweight, versatile workstation for Android analysis.  
- **VirtualBox & Proxmox** – Open-source hypervisors used to create isolated, sterile virtual environments.  
- **Windows 10** – Operating system deployed in the virtual environments for familiarity and ease of use.  

## Key Topics
- Creating isolated virtual environments for forensic analysis  
- Installation and setup of mobile forensics tools  
- Importing and analyzing datasets of Android devices acquired from NIST
- Comparing tool functionality, user interface, performance and results of analysis


## Findings & Insights
- Open-source tools can provide students with practical skills comparable to commercial solutions.  
- Autopsy is more resource-intensive, while Avilla Forensics is lightweight and portable, making it suitable for lower-spec machines.  
- Analysis can include device metadata, call logs, contacts, SMS/MMS, emails, and GPS data.  
- Hands-on practice in controlled environments strengthens understanding of mobile forensics workflows.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Mobile device forensic analysis  
- Tool evaluation and comparison  
- Virtual environment setup and management  
- Analytical reasoning and workflow planning
